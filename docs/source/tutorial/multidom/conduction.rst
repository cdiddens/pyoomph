Temperature conduction through two bodies of different conductivity
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For a simple start, a static (i.e. non-moving) one-dimensional mesh consisting of two domains will be considered. The mesh should contain two interval domains ``"domainL"`` and ``"domainR"``, ranging from :math:`0` to :math:`x_\text{I}` and from :math:`x_\text{I}` to :math:`L` respectively, which are connected at a mutual interface ``"interface"`` at :math:`x_\text{I}`. We use the :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.MeshTemplate` class to provide such a mesh (cf. :numref:`secspatialmeshgen` for details):

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.equations.poisson import *

   class TwoDomainMesh1d(MeshTemplate):
   	def __init__(self,Ntot=100,xI=1,L=2,left_domain_name="domainA",right_domain_name="domainB"):
   		super(TwoDomainMesh1d,self).__init__()
   		self.Ntot, self.xI, self.L = Ntot, xI, L
   		self.left_domain_name,self.right_domain_name=left_domain_name,right_domain_name

   	def define_geometry(self):
   		xI=self.nondim_size(self.xI)
   		L=self.nondim_size(self.L)
   		NA=round(self.Ntot*xI/L) # number of elements on domainA calculated from total number 
   		
   		domainA=self.new_domain(self.left_domain_name)
   		domainB=self.new_domain(self.right_domain_name)
   		
   		# Generate nodes 
   		nodesA=[self.add_node_unique(x) for x in numpy.linspace(0,xI,NA)]
   		for x0,x1 in zip(nodesA, nodesA[1:]):
   			domainA.add_line_1d_C1(x0,x1)	# and elements by pairs of nodes
   			
   		# same for domainB
   		nodesB=[self.add_node_unique(x) for x in numpy.linspace(xI,L,self.Ntot-NA)]
   		for x0,x1 in zip(nodesB, nodesB[1:]):
   			domainB.add_line_1d_C1(x0,x1)
   			
   		# marking boundaries
   		self.add_nodes_to_boundary("left",[nodesA[0]])
   		self.add_nodes_to_boundary("interface",[nodesB[0]]) # coordsB[0] is actually = coordsA[-1]
   		self.add_nodes_to_boundary("right",[nodesB[-1]])

Note how we create two domains with the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.MeshTemplate.new_domain` calls and add line elements to both of these domains. During the latter, we use ``zip`` with a shifted node list to get the nodes in pairs, i.e. (node0,node1), (node1,node2), etc., to build the elements. It is important to note, since :py:meth:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.MeshTemplate.add_node_unique` will not create new nodes if a node is already existing at a point, that ``domainA[-1]`` is the very same node as ``domainB[0]``. Thereby, this node, which is marked to be the interface ``"interface"``, is part of both domains.

.. warning::

   If you want to couple the equations on different domains at mutual interfaces, all involved domains have to be generated within the very same :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.MeshTemplate` (or :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.gmsh.GmshTemplate`). It is not possible to couple e.g. two :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.LineMesh` instances at an interface, even not if the position and the name of the interface is matching.

On the domains A and B, we want to solve the (nondimensional) temperature conduction equations, i.e. the Poisson equations

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \nabla\cdot\left(k_\text{A}\nabla T_\text{A}\right)&=0&\text{on domainA}\\
   \nabla\cdot\left(k_\text{B}\nabla T_\text{B}\right)&=0&\text{on domainB}
   \end{aligned}

with the, in general different, thermal conductivities :math:`k_\text{A}` and :math:`k_\text{B}`. The solution shall be subject to the boundary conditions :math:`T_\text{A}(0)=0` and :math:`T_\text{B}(L)=1`. At the mutual interface ``"interface"`` at :math:`x_\text{I}`, we want to have a continuous temperature, i.e. :math:`T_\text{A}(x_\text{I})=T_\text{B}(x_\text{I})`. While the former boundary conditions can be realized by trivial :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.bcs.DirichletBC`, the latter requires some additional consideration, since it involves the temperature field on two different domains. We can write the boundary condition as constraint with an associated Lagrange multiplier :math:`\lambda` defined on the interface ``"interface"``. As usual, the constraint can be thought as minimization of the Lagrange multiplier contribution

.. math:: \lambda \; \left(T_\text{A}-T_\text{B}\right)

with respect to :math:`\lambda`, :math:`T_\text{A}` and :math:`T_\text{B}`. Let the corresponding test functions be :math:`\eta`, :math:`\Theta_\text{A}` and :math:`\Theta_\text{B}`, then the corresponding weak terms read

.. math:: :label: eqmultidomcontitweak

   \left\langle T_\text{A}-T_\text{B},\eta \right\rangle+\left\langle \lambda,\Theta_\text{A} \right\rangle+\left\langle -\lambda,\Theta_\text{B} \right\rangle

In pyoomph, we can write again an :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.InterfaceEquations` class for this:

.. code:: python

   class ConnectTAtInterface(InterfaceEquations):		
   	def define_fields(self):
   		self.define_scalar_field("lambda","C2") # Lagrange multiplier
   		
   	def define_residuals(self):
   		my_field,my_test=var_and_test("T") # T on the domain where this InterfaceEquations object is attached to
   		opp_field,opp_test=var_and_test("T",domain=self.get_opposite_side_of_interface()) # T on the interface, but evaluated in the opposite domain
   		lagr,lagr_test=var_and_test("lambda") # Lagrange multiplier
   		self.add_residual(weak(my_field-opp_field,lagr_test)) # constraint T_my-T_opp=0
   		self.add_residual(weak(lagr,my_test)) # Lagrange Neumann contribution to the inside domain
   		self.add_residual(weak(-lagr,opp_test)) # Lagrange Neumann contribution to the outside domain

We introduce again the Lagrange multiplier :math:`\lambda` at the interface and add the weak contributions to the residuals. Later on, the ``ConnectTAtInterface`` object will be added to the ``"interface"`` of either ``"domainA"`` or ``"domainB"``, i.e. to ``@"domainA/interface"`` or ``@"domainB/interface"``. In both domains, we will have the temperature field ``var("T")`` defined. To distinguish between the fields on the inside (i.e. the domain where the ``ConnectAtInterface`` is attached to) and the outside (i.e. the opposite domain), we must use :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations.get_opposite_side_of_interface` for the ``domain`` to clearly state that we want to get the temperature of the opposite side of the interface, i.e. the temperature ``var("T")`` at the ``"interface"``, but evaluated at the opposite domain. Alternatively, we could have used ``var("T",domain="|.")`` as shortcut. It will also return the temperature field of the opposite side of the interface. To access the opposite bulk domain instead, use :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations.get_opposite_parent_domain` as ``domain`` or the shortcut ``var("T",domain="|..")``.

The driver code is quite trivial

.. code:: python

   class TwoDomainTemperatureConduction(Problem):
   	def __init__(self):
   		super(TwoDomainTemperatureConduction,self).__init__()
   		self.conductivityA=0.5	# thermal conductivity of domain A
   		self.conductivityB=2	# thermal conductivity of domain B
   		
   	def define_problem(self):
   		self.add_mesh(TwoDomainMesh1d())
   		
   		# Assemble equations domainA
   		eqsA=TextFileOutput()
   		eqsA+=PoissonEquation(name="T",space="C2",coefficient=self.conductivityA,source=0)
   		eqsA+=DirichletBC(T=0)@"left"

   		# and equations of domainB
   		eqsB=TextFileOutput()
   		eqsB+=PoissonEquation(name="T",space="C2",coefficient=self.conductivityB,source=0)		
   		eqsB+=DirichletBC(T=1)@"right"	
   		
   		# Interface connection. Must be added to one side of the interface, i.e. alternatively to eqsB
   		eqsA+=ConnectTAtInterface()@"interface"
   		
   		self.add_equations(eqsA@"domainA")
   		self.add_equations(eqsB@"domainB")		

   		
   if __name__=="__main__":
   	with TwoDomainTemperatureConduction() as problem:

   		problem.output()

We add only one mesh, but assemble two Poisson equations, each with a different ``coefficient`` and with different :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.bcs.DirichletBC` terms. At the very end, the equations are restricted to ``"domainA"`` and ``"domainB"``, respectively. The ``ConnectTAtInterface`` can be either added to ``"domainA/interface"`` or ``"domainB/interface"``, but not on both simultaneously, since this would overconstrain the problem. The result is plotted in :numref:`figmultidomtempconduction1d`.

In terms of physics within this problem, we wonder of course, whether the heat flux :math:`\vec{q}=-k\nabla T` is indeed the same across the interface. Since the normals in ``"domainA"`` and ``"domainB"`` at the ``"interface"`` obey the relation :math:`\vec{n}_\text{A}=-\vec{n}_\text{B}`, a continuous heat flux would mean that

.. math:: :label: eqmultidomcontitqflux

   \left(\vec{q}_\text{A}-\vec{q}_\text{B}\right)\cdot\vec{n}_\text{A}=-k_\text{A}\partial_xT_\text{A}+k_\text{B}\partial_xT_\text{B}=0\,.

From the results in :numref:`figmultidomtempconduction1d`, we see that :math:`\partial_xT_\text{A}=0.8` and :math:`\partial_xT_\text{B}=0.2`, and due to :math:`k_\text{A}=0.5` and :math:`k_\text{B}=2`, it is indeed fulfilled. This is not just coincidence! From the weak form :math:numref:`eqmultidomcontitweak` of the enforced continuity of :math:`T`, we see that we impose :math:`\lambda` as Neumann flux to ``"domainA"`` and :math:`-\lambda` to ``"domainB"``. The Neumann flux is exactly the heat flux and so continuity of this relation is actually a result of the enforcing. This also works, if the temperatures have a prescribed offset :math:`\Delta T` in the enforcing, which would read

.. math:: \left\langle T_\text{A}-T_\text{B}-\Delta T,\eta \right\rangle+\left\langle \lambda,\Theta_\text{A} \right\rangle+\left\langle -\lambda,\Theta_\text{B} \right\rangle

Hence, when enforcing continuity of fields across interfaces this way, one automatically gets the correct physics, here the continuity of the transported heat across the interface. However, :math:numref:`eqmultidomcontitqflux` would be violated if the weak forms of the Poisson equations would be e.g. multiplied by different factor in both domains, since this factor would also affect the Neumann term. Therefore, one has to pay attention.

.. warning::

   Due to the above argument, one should not be tempted to set different scalings via :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.set_scaling` of the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class or by the :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.Scaling` in dimensional problems. This can easily invalidate the continuity of the Neumann flux, which can lead to unphysical behavior. If one uses the same scale for non-dimensionalization of e.g. the temperature, e.g. by setting ``set_scaling(T=1*kelvin)`` at :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` level, this issue can be circumvented.

.. note::

   It is cumbersome to write a coupling interface like the ``ConnectTAtInterface`` here for every field you want to connect at inter-domain interfaces. pyoomph has already the predefined class :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.ConnectFieldsAtInterface`, which allows enforcing continuity of scalar fields. In the current problem, we could just use ``ConnectFieldsAtInterface("T")`` instead of our custom class ``ConnectTAtInterface``.
