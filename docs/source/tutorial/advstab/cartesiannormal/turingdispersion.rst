Numerically obtaining the dispersion relation of a Turing instability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The additional Cartesian mode can be even used if :math:`N=0` holds, i.e. we can expand a single point to an interval of length :math:`[0:2\pi/k)` (with periodic boundary conditions) and determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions here. This allows to quickly scan over :math:`k` to numerically extract a dispersion relation. We will discuss this here for a simple Turing instability (see :cite:`Turing1952,Gierer1972,Schnorr2023` for more details).

We begin by the equation class, which takes the diffusivity ratio and the reaction terms of the activator and inhibitor as arguments:

.. code:: python

	class TuringEquations(Equations):
	    def __init__(self,d,f,g):
		super().__init__()
		self.d=d # Diffusivity ratio
		self.f,self.g=f,g # Reaction terms
		
	    def define_fields(self):
		self.define_scalar_field("u","C2") # activator
		self.define_scalar_field("v","C2") # inhibitor
		
	    def define_residuals(self):
		u,utest=var_and_test("u")
		v,vtest=var_and_test("v")
		self.add_weak(partial_t(u)-self.f,utest).add_weak(grad(u),grad(utest)) 
		self.add_weak(partial_t(v)-self.g,vtest).add_weak(self.d*grad(v),grad(vtest))

The problem class now just defines the reaction terms according to the Gierer-Meinhardt model :cite:`Gierer1972,Schnorr2023`. We then add a :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.PointMesh`, which is :math:`0`-dimensional mesh consisting only of a single point and define the just developed equations on this mesh. Of course, on such a mesh, we could only get the eigendynamics of the ODEs :math:`\dot u=f, \dot v=g`, arising in absence of the diffusion terms. However, we will soon use the additional Cartesian normal mode to add a single :math:`x`-coordinate to quickly and exactly (i.e. without any spatial discretization) calculate the eigenvalues of the corresponding one-dimensional system, i.e. with diffusion terms.

.. code:: python

	class TuringProblem(Problem):
	    def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		# Parameters, see https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-023-06334-9
		self.d,self.a,self.b,self.c=self.define_global_parameter(d=40,a=0.01,b=1.2,c = 0.7)        
		# Reaction terms
		self.f=self.a-self.b*var("u")+var("u")**2/(var("v")*(1+self.c*var("u")**2))
		self.g=var("u")**2-var("v")
		
	    def define_problem(self):        
		# We add a 0d mesh here. So we do not have any spatial information
		from pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes import PointMesh
		self+=PointMesh()
		eqs=TuringEquations(self.d,self.f,self.g)
		# Some reasonable guess here (not the exact solution)
		eqs+=InitialCondition(u=(self.a + 1)/self.b, v=(self.a + 1)**2/self.b**2)
		self+=eqs@"domain"
		
		
In the driver code, we call :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.setup_for_stability_analysis` with  ``additional_cartesian_mode=True`` to add the additional Cartesian normal mode. Supplying ``normal_mode_k=k`` during the calls of :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve_eigenproblem` will select the wavenumber :math:`k` for such a one-dimensional case.
We can thereby quickly scan the full dispersion relation:

.. code:: python

	with TuringProblem() as problem:
	    # Take a quick C compiler, to speed up the code generation
	    problem.set_c_compiler("tcc")
	    # Important part: This will add the N+1 dimension allowing for perturbations like exp(i*k*x+lambda*t)
	    problem.setup_for_stability_analysis(additional_cartesian_mode=True)
	    # Solve for the flat stationary solution
	    problem.solve()
	    # And scan over the k values, solve the normal mode eigenvalue problem and write the results to a file
	    output=problem.create_text_file_output("dispersion.txt",header=["k","ReLamba1","ReLambda2","ImLambda1","ImLambda2"])    
	    for k in numpy.linspace(0,1,400):
		problem.solve_eigenproblem(2,normal_mode_k=k)
		evs=problem.get_last_eigenvalues()
		output.add_row(k,numpy.real(evs[0]),numpy.real(evs[1]),numpy.imag(evs[0]),numpy.imag(evs[1]))
		

Of course, the results depicted in :numref:`figturingdispersion` can also be calculated analytically. However, it is already rather complicated to find the stationary base solution. Also, it is only a few lines of code and we have already implemented our equation class to be used in arbitrary dimensions and coordinate systems.

In particular, we can quickly get a good guess for the dominant wavenumber, here around :math:`k=0.46`. This can be used to estimate a reasonable domain size for e.g. a two-dimensional transient simulation, where we can reuse the existing equation and problem class to obtain Turing patterns as depicted in :numref:`figturingtransient`. The corresponding script can be found here: :download:`turing_transient.py`.

	After finding the dominant wave number, we can run transient 2d simulations with a suitable domain size.
