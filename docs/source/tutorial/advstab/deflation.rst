Deflated continuation
---------------------

While is it is hard to guarantee that one has found all solutions of a nonlinear problem at a specific parameter, arclength continuation and bifurcation analysis helps to find connected branches, by scanning all branches as function of the parameter and also following new branches emerging e.g. at pitchfork bifurcations, one usually finds the most important stable and unstable solutions.
However, there are also problems which have disconnected solutions, i.e. the mentioned procedure will never reach the disconnected solutions as they do not meet in any bifurcations.
