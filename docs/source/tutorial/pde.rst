Spatio-Temporal Differential Equations
======================================

Spatio-temporal differential equations are partial differential equations involving both derivatives with respect to space and time. We started our journey with temporal ODEs in :numref:`secspatial`. Now, it is time to combine both parts. Essentially, when discretizing spatio-temporal differential equations in space, one obtains a large system of temporal ODEs, which are then solved by temporal integration.
