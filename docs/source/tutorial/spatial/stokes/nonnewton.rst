Non-Newtoninan fluids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now want to consider a nonlinear Stokes equation by letting the viscosity depend on the shear rate. Thereby, the normally linear Stokes equation becomes nonlinear and highly dependent on the initial guess. However, shear-thickening or -thinning fluids can be found in reality. We can easily reuse our previous implementation of the Stokes problem by passing a shear dependent viscosity to the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class which forwards it to the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` class, where it is ultimately evaluated in the weak form implementation. For simplicity, we set the viscosity to :math:`\mu=1+\dot{\gamma}`, where :math:`\dot{\gamma}=\sqrt{2\mathbf{S}:\mathbf{S}}` with the shear tensor :math:`\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla\vec{u}+\nabla\vec{u}^\text{t}\right)`:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from stokes import * # Import the previous Stokes problem
   		
   if __name__ == "__main__":		

   	# bind the velocity as variable
   	u=var("velocity")
   	# symmetrized shear
   	S=sym(grad(u))
   	# get the scalar shear rate by sqrt(2*S:S)
   	shear_rate=square_root(2*contract(S,S))
   	# Shear thickening fluid -> viscosity increases with increasing shear
   	# we wrap it in a subexpression since the viscosity appears in the equation for u_x and u_y
   	# Thereby, the viscosity will be only evaluated once in the compiled code, which speeds up the calculation
   	mu=subexpression(1+shear_rate)
   	
   	# pass it to the Stokes problem, which will pass it to the equations
   	with StokesSpaceTestProblem(mu,"C2","C1") as problem: 
   	
   		# Since the problem is nonlinear, it is essential to provide a good guess for the initial condition
   		# Here, we use the one of the Poiseuille flow for Newtonian liquids
   		y=var("coordinate_y")
   		ux_init=y*(1-y)
   		# We can add arbitrary equations/conditions to the problem by adding them to additional_equations
   		# Here, we set the initial condition to help the nonlinear problem to converge
   		problem.additional_equations+=InitialCondition(velocity_x=ux_init)@"domain"
   		
   		problem.solve() # solve and output
   		problem.output()
   	
   		

This example again shows the power of pyoomph: At any stage, we can define quite arbitrary expressions and pass them via the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class to the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` class, where they are evaluated in the weak form. To get the strain rate, we first bind the variable field by ``u=var("velocity")``, although it is not known here at all. The symmetrized strain tensor is again calculated via :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.sym` and :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.grad`, ``S=sym(grad(u))``, and we get :math:`\dot \gamma` via applying :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.square_root` on the contraction :math:`\mathbf{S}:\mathbf{S}` (using :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.contract`). To speed up the code, the dynamic viscosity is again wrapped in a :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.subexpression`.

Since the problem is now strongly nonlinear, it is essential to provide a reasonable initial guess. We could write our own :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class, but we also can add further equations to a given :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class by adding those to the property :py:attr:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.additional_equations`. Of course, we have to restrict them to the ``"domain"``, i.e. on the domain where the equation should be solved.
