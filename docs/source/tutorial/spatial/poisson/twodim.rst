Two-dimensional Poisson equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All previous discussions so far were exemplified on a 1d domain. Pyoomph makes it very simple to use equations on arbitrary domains. Since we have formulated the ``PoissonEquation`` and the Neumann boundary conditions in :download:`poisson.py` and :download:`poisson_robin_via_neumann.py` with :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.grad`, the definition is not restricted to any particular number of the dimensions. To solve it on a 2d rectangular domain, we can hence directly reuse the equation classes and the boundary conditions defined above. To solve i.e. the system

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   -\nabla^2 u(x,y) &=100\exp\left(-100(x-0.5)^2-100(y-0.5)^2 \right) \\
   u&=0 \quad \text{at} \quad x=0 \\
   u&=0 \quad \text{at} \quad x=1 \\
   \partial_y u&=-2 \quad \text{at} \quad y=0 \\
   u+\partial_y u&=-1 \quad \text{at} \quad y=1
   \end{aligned}

We just have to assemble the system on a 2d geometry, which is predefinned in pyoomph in the :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.RectangularQuadMesh`:

.. code:: python

   # Import all PoissonEquation, Neumann and Robin condition as before
   from poisson_robin_via_neumann import *
   from pyoomph.expressions import * # Import vector


   class PoissonProblem2d(Problem):
       def define_problem(self):
           # Create a 2d mesh, 10x10 elements, spanning from (0,0) to (1,1)
           mesh=RectangularQuadMesh(size=[1,1],lower_left=[0,0],N=10)
           self.add_mesh(mesh)

           # Assemble the system, bulk, then boundaries
           x=var("coordinate")-vector([0.5,0.5]) # position vector shifted by 0.5,0.5
           peak_source=100*exp(-100*dot(x,x))
           equations=PoissonEquation(source=peak_source)
           equations += DirichletBC(u=0) @ "left"
           equations += DirichletBC(u=0) @ "right"
           equations += PoissonNeumannCondition("u",2) @ "bottom"
           equations += PoissonRobinCondition("u", 1,1,-1) @ "top"
           # Also add an output. This VTU output can be viewed with Paraview
           equations += MeshFileOutput()

           self.add_equations(equations@"domain")

   if __name__=="__main__":
       with PoissonProblem2d() as problem:
           problem.solve()
           problem.output()

Obviously, the definition of the system in pyoomph is almost identical to the mathematical definition above. One only needs to know the default names of the :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.RectangularQuadMesh` class, which are ``"domain"`` for the inner domain and ``"left"``, ``"right"``, ``"bottom"`` and ``"top"`` for the boundaries. The source function now depends on the coordinate vector :math:`\vec{x}`. This one can be accessed via ``var("coordinate")``. Since it is a vector, one has to use e.g. :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.dot` to calculate the square and subtract also the vectorial offset :math:`(0.5,0.5)` via ``vector([0.5,0.5])``. Elements of vectors can be accessed by e.g. ``var("coordinate")[0]`` and ``var("coordinate")[1]``.
