One-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us first consider the Poisson equation on a simple interval, i.e. on the domain :math:`\Omega=[-1,1]`. Furthermore, we initially restrict to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions :math:`u=0` at :math:`x=-1` and :math:`x=1`. The source function is simply :math:`g=1`. If there are no Neumann conditions, the weak formulation :math:numref:`eqspatialpoissonweak` reduces to

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \left(\nabla u,\nabla v\right)-\left(g, v\right)=0\,. 
   \end{aligned}

This weak form is implemented in a :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` class as follows:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.expressions import *  # Import grad & weak


   class PoissonEquation(Equations):
       def __init__(self, *, name="u", space="C2", source=0):
           super(PoissonEquation, self).__init__()
           self.name = name  # store the variable name
           self.space = space  # the finite element space
           self.source = source  # and the source function g

       def define_fields(self):
           self.define_scalar_field(self.name, self.space)  # define the unknown scalar field

       def define_residuals(self):
           u, v = var_and_test(self.name)  # get the unknown field and the corresponding test function
           # weak formulation in residual form: (grad(u),grad(v))-(g,v)
           residual = weak(grad(u), grad(v)) - weak(self.source, v)
           self.add_residual(residual)  # add it to the residual

We define a new class ``PoissonEquation``, inherited from the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` class. In the constructor, we allow to pass the source function :math:`g`, a name of the unknown field :math:`u` (defaults to ``"u"``) and a finite element space, which defaults to ``"C2"``. More on finite element spaces will be discussed later on in :numref:`secspatialbasisfuncs`. The passed arguments are stored in the object.

In the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.BaseEquations.define_fields` method, we use :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations.define_scalar_field` to create a field with the desired name ``self.name`` on the finite element space ``self.space``. Finally, in the method :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.BaseEquations.define_residuals`, the residual form is defined. To that end, we first bind the local variables ``u`` and ``v`` to the unknown field :math:`u` and the corresponding test function :math:`v`. The shorthand notations :math:`(\ldots,\ldots)` for the spatial integrals (cf. :math:numref:`eqspatialweakshorthand`) are written in python via the function :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.weak`. The gradients of both the unknown field :math:`u` and the test function :math:`v` are obtained :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.grad`, i.e. by ``grad(u)`` and ``grad(v)``, respectively. The weak form in residual formulation, stored in the local variable ``residual`` is eventually added by the method :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.BaseEquations.add_residual`, which completes the definition of the weak form of the ``PoissonEquation``.

To actually use this equation, we again have to write a problem class, inherited from the generic :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` class:

.. code:: python

   class PoissonProblem(Problem):
       def define_problem(self):
           mesh = LineMesh(minimum=-1, size=2, N=100)  # Line mesh from [-1:1] with 100 elements
           # Add the mesh (default name is "domain" with boundaries "left" and "right")
           self.add_mesh(mesh)

           # Assemble the system
           equations = PoissonEquation(source=1)  # create a Poisson equation with source g=1
           equations += DirichletBC(u=0) @ "left"  # Dirichlet condition u=0 on the left boundary
           equations += DirichletBC(u=0) @ "right"  # and u=0 on the right boundary
           equations += TextFileOutput()  # Add a simple text file output
           self.add_equations(equations @ "domain")  # Add the equation system on the domain named "domain"

Again, the work is done in the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.define_problem` method. First of all, we need to define the geometry where the equation should be solved. Geometries in pyoomph are always defined via mesh templates. A mesh template provides spatially discretized geometric domains with named boundaries. The simplest mesh template is the :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.LineMesh`, which is just an interval subdivided into :math:`N` elements. To create the desired domain :math:`\Omega=[-1,1]`, we pass the keyword arguments ``minimum=-1`` and ``size=2`` and divide it into ``N=100`` elements. This mesh template is added to the problem with the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.add_mesh` method. A mesh template has named domains and boundaries. The default names for the :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.LineMesh` are ``"domain"`` for the domain, i.e. here :math:`[-1,1]`, ``"left"`` for the left boundary, i.e. :math:`x=-1` and ``"right"`` for the right boundary, here :math:`x=1`.

Then, the equation system is assembled. We create the previously implemented equation class ``PoissonEquation``, setting the ``source`` function :math:`g` to :math:`1`. We then add :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.bcs.DirichletBC` objects and use the ``@`` operator to restrict these Dirichlet conditions to the boundaries ``"left"`` and ``"right``. Also a :py:class:`~pyoomph.output.generic.TextFileOutput` is added to the equation system to provide output as a simple text file. Finally, the entire system stored in :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` is added to the problem via :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.add_equations`. Note that we have to restrict the equations once more to the desired domain ``"domain"`` which is provided by the previously added mesh template, i.e. the added :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes.LineMesh`.

Finally, we just have to create the problem, solve it and write the output via

.. code:: python

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       with PoissonProblem() as problem:
           problem.solve()  # Solve the problem
           problem.output()  # Write output

Opposed to the ODEs in the previous chapter, there is no need for a temporal integration, i.e. the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.run` method of the problem is not required, but instead we use :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve`. We also have to manually call the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.output` method to write the output to file, which is plotted in :numref:`figspatialpoisson1d`.
