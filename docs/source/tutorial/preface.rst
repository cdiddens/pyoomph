Preface
=========================

This tutorial is not intended to be a full reference sheet of all functions pyoomph can offer. However, reading it will gradually guide you through all the important features pyoomph has to offer. Since these capabilities will be introduced where necessary, it is best to read this tutorial completely and trying out all the explained capabilities along the course.

Alternatively, you could just try to start somewhere in a section of interest and search this tutorial for any occuring function or approach. If you are interested e.g. in solving multi-phase & multi-component flow dynamics with mass transfer, just start your journey in :numref:`secmcflow` and backtrack by searching this tutorial whenever something is not clear.
