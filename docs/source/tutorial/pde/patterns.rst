Pattern formation, stability analysis and bifurcation tracking
--------------------------------------------------------------

Nonlinear PDEs are often analyzed in terms of bifurcations, stability, hysteresis, etc. To that end, one usually finds stationary solutions and investigate the stability of these by linear stability analysis. However, whenever the stationary solution is complicated or not even analytically available, this process has to be done numerically. This can easily be done in pyoomph.
