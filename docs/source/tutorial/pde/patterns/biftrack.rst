Stability via bifurcation tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We could now perform similar scans for different :math:`\delta`, but there is a simpler route, namely bifurcation tracking. We can instruct pyoomph to find the fold bifurcation and its corresponding value of :math:`\gamma\approx 0.2826` directly:

.. code:: python

   from kuramoto_sivanshinsky_arclength_eigen import * # Import the previous problem

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       with KSEBifurcationProblem() as problem:
           # Output the zeroth eigenvector. Will only output if the eigenvalue/vector is calculated either by
           # solve_eigenproblem or by bifurcation tracking
           problem.additional_equations+=MeshFileOutput(eigenvector=0,eigenmode="real",filetrunk="eigen0_real")@"domain"

           problem.initialise()
           problem.param_gamma.value=0.24
           problem.param_delta.value = 0.0
           problem.set_initial_condition(ic_name="hexdots")
           problem.solve(timestep=10) # One transient step to converge towards the stationary solution
           problem.solve() # stationary solve

           # from the previous example we know that the fold bifurcation happens close to 0.28
           problem.param_gamma.value=0.28
           problem.solve() # solve at gamma=0.28

           # Activate bifurcation tracking
           problem.activate_bifurcation_tracking(problem.param_gamma,"fold")
           problem.solve()
           print("FOLD BIFURCATION HAPPENS AT",problem.param_gamma.value)

To that end, we first move close to the bifurcation, i.e. to :math:`\gamma=0.28` and :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve` to find a good guess. Then, we :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.activate_bifurcation_tracking` for a ``"fold"`` bifurcation in :math:`\gamma`. Within the next :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve` command, the value of :math:`\gamma` will be adjusted (i.e. :math:`\gamma` is in fact a degree of freedom) so that the system is directly at the fold bifurcation. We also output the eigenvector directly at the fold bifurcation. To that end, another :py:class:`~pyoomph.output.meshio.MeshFileOutput` is added, but with the arguments ``eigenvector=0`` (meaning the zeroth eigenvector) and ``eigenmode="real"`` (i.e. considering the real part, although this particular eigenvector is real anyhow). We furthermore must supply a ``filetrunk`` to prevent overwriting of the output files of the solution itself.

Once we are on the bifurcation, we can sweep over :math:`\delta` and follow the position of the fold bifurcation. As long as the bifurcation tracking is active :math:`\gamma` will be adjusted to stay on the fold bifurcation, i.e. we get a curve :math:`\gamma_\text{fold}(\delta)`, which is written to file:

.. code:: python

           hexfold_file = open(os.path.join(problem.get_output_directory(), "hexfold.txt"), "w")
           def output_with_params():
               h_rms = problem.get_mesh("domain").evaluate_observable("h_rms")  # get the root mean square
               line = [problem.param_gamma.value, problem.param_delta.value,h_rms]  # line to write
               hexfold_file.write("\t".join(map(str, line)) + "\n")  # write to file
               hexfold_file.flush()
               problem.output_at_increased_time()  # and write the output

           output_with_params()
           ds = 0.025
           while problem.param_delta.value < 0.5:
               ds = problem.arclength_continuation(problem.param_delta, ds, max_ds=0.025)
               output_with_params()

The result, i.e. the location of the fold bifurcation, is depicted in :numref:`figpdeksefold2`.

Similarly, we can set the other :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.InitialCondition` to start with hexagonal holes or stripe patterns and find the bifurcations.
