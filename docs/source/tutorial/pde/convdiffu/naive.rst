Naive implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us first ignore this complication and implement the equation naively. We will add a flag ``advection_in_partial_integration`` to choose between both different weak forms of the advection term:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.expressions import *


   class ConvectionDiffusionEquation(Equations):
   	def __init__(self,u,D,advection_in_partial_integration,space="C2"):
   		super(ConvectionDiffusionEquation, self).__init__()
   		self.u=u # advection velocity
   		self.D=D # diffusivity		
   		self.space=space # space of the field c
   		self.advection_in_partial_integration=advection_in_partial_integration # Which weak form to use
   		
   	def define_fields(self):
   		self.define_scalar_field("c",self.space) # The scalar field to advect
   		
   	def define_residuals(self):
   		c,phi=var_and_test("c")
   		# Advection either intergrated by parts or not
   		advection=-weak(self.u*c,grad(phi)) if self.advection_in_partial_integration else weak(div(self.u*c),phi)
   		# TPZ or MPT time stepping can be of advantage compared to BDF2
   		self.add_residual(time_scheme("TPZ",weak(partial_t(c),phi)+advection+weak(self.D*grad(c),grad(phi))))

Depending on the value of ``advection_in_partial_integration``, we either use :math:numref:`eqpdeconvdiffuweakA` or :math:numref:`eqpdeconvdiffuweakB` for the weak form. Furthermore, we changed the time stepping from the default ``"BDF2"`` to ``"TPZ"``, which can be of advantage (cf. :numref:`secODEtimescheme` for time stepping methods).

As a problem class, we use bump which is swirled around by one period. When the diffusivity is low, we expect the bump to be only slightly smaller in amplitude and only slightly coarser due to diffusion. The problem class hence reads:

.. code:: python

   class ConvectionDiffusionProblem(Problem):
   	def __init__(self):
   		super(ConvectionDiffusionProblem, self).__init__()
   		self.u=2*pi*vector([-var("coordinate_y"),var("coordinate_x")]) # Circular flow, one rotation at t=1
   		self.D=0.001 # diffusivity
   		self.L=1 # size of the mesh
   		self.N=4 # number of elements of the coarsest mesh in each direction		
   		self.max_refinement_level=5 # max refinement level
   		self.advection_in_partial_integration=False # which weak form to choose
   		
   	def define_problem(self):
   		self.add_mesh(RectangularQuadMesh(lower_left=-self.L/2,size=self.L,N=self.N))
   		
   		eqs=ConvectionDiffusionEquation(self.u,self.D,self.advection_in_partial_integration)
   		eqs+=MeshFileOutput() # output
   		
   		# use a bump as initial condition
   		bump_pos=vector([-self.L/5,0]) # center pos of the bump
   		bump_width=0.005*self.L # width of the bump
   		bump_amplitude=1 # amplitude of the bump
   		xdiff=var("coordinate")-bump_pos # difference between coordinate and bump center
   		bump=bump_amplitude*exp(-dot(xdiff,xdiff)/bump_width) # Gaussian bump
   		eqs+=InitialCondition(c=bump)

   		# Set the boundaries to 0
   		for b in ["top","left","right","bottom"]:
   			eqs+=DirichletBC(c=0)@b

   		# Errors: We evaluate the jumps in the gradients of c at the element boundaries, i.e. when crossing to the next element
   		# this is not only done at the current time step, but also on the previous one
   		error_fluxes=[grad(var("c")),evaluate_in_past(grad(var("c")))]
   		eqs+=SpatialErrorEstimator(*error_fluxes)
   		
   		self.add_equations(eqs@"domain") # adding the equation

The most interesting thing here is that we can also define a :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.SpatialErrorEstimator` based on history values. Instead of passing keyword arguments, we can also pass positional arguments to the :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.SpatialErrorEstimator`. The error estimator requires gradients, but these can also be evaluated at previous time steps. This ensures that the wake remains finer resolved.

The run code is again simple:

.. code:: python

   if __name__=="__main__":
   	with ConvectionDiffusionProblem() as problem:
   		problem.advection_in_partial_integration=True # Can also set it to false
   		problem.D=0.0001 # diffusivity		
   		problem.run(1,outstep=0.01,maxstep=0.0025,spatial_adapt=1,temporal_error=1)

Using ``outstep=0.01`` in the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.run`, we will get 100 outputs, but due to ``maxstep=0.0025``, we solve at least 4 times per output. ``spatial_adapt=1`` will perform, as usual, one spatial adaption per solve, whereas ``temporal_error=1`` just ensures that the time step gets reduced when it does not converge.

Results at different times are depicted in :numref:`figpdesimpleconvdiffu`.
