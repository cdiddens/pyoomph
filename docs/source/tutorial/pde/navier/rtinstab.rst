Rayleigh-Taylor instability
---------------------------

Now, we can make use of the power of pyoomph to easily couple the Navier-Stokes equations with an advection-diffusion equation. Here, we will solve a denser fluid residing atop of a less dense fluid. We apply the *Boussinesq approximation*, i.e. the mass density :math:`\rho` is assumed to be constant in the continuity equation and also in the inertia term, but the bulk force will depend on the varying density. We set the bulk force to :math:`\vec{f}=-100 c \vec{e}_y` and solve for the composition field :math:`c` that ranges from :math:`0` (bottom light fluid) to :math:`1` (heavier top fluid). We choose a small diffusivity so that advection can dominate. For the equations for the advection-diffusion of :math:`c` and the velocity-pressure pair, we use the predefined equations from pyoomph. The corresponding classes are :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes.NavierStokesEquations` and :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.advection_diffusion.AdvectionDiffusionEquations`. However, we could also use the equations we have developed in the previous sections instead.

If you have read the tutorial up to here, you should understand all steps. The idea is to create a :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes.NavierStokesEquations` object with a body force depending on the variable ``var("c")``. This variable is defined and solved in the :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.advection_diffusion.AdvectionDiffusionEquations`, which in turn get the field ``var("velocity")`` for the advection. Thereby, both parts are coupled. Since we allow no normal outflow, we have to fix a single pressure degree, which we do in the lower left corner. The results are depicted in :numref:`figpderayleightaylor`.
