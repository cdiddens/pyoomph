The wave equation
-----------------

The wave equation can be considered as coupling between the harmonic oscillators discussed in :numref:`secode` and the Poisson equation discussed in :numref:`secspatialpoisson`. As such, we will combine both temporal and spatial derivatives, which are both extensively discussed in the aforementioned sections.
