Compression of 2D circular disk 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
	The following case is a direct adaption of the `corresponding example in oomph-lib <https://oomph-lib.github.io/oomph-lib/doc/solid/disk_compression/html/index.html>`__.

We consider a 2d disc that is compressed by a uniform pressure. The disc initially has a radius of unity, however, we introduce a isotropic growth factor of :math:`\Gamma=1.1`, so that the disc wants to grow to a radius of :math:`\sqrt{\Gamma}` is absence of any external pressure. Opposed to the `corresponding example in oomph-lib <https://oomph-lib.github.io/oomph-lib/doc/solid/disk_compression/html/index.html>`__, we will come up with two implementations of the very same case. We either can solve the problem on a quarter circle mesh with symmetry boundary conditions in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. However, due to the coordinate-system agnostic formulation of equations, the same can be realized by a simple radial line mesh in a polar coordinate system. To that end, we introduce a flag ``polar_implementation`` in the problem class:


.. code:: python

	from pyoomph import *
	from pyoomph.expressions import *
	from pyoomph.equations.solid import *
	from pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes import CircularMesh

	class CompressedDiscProblem(Problem):
	    def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		self.Gamma=1.1 # isotropic growth factor
		self.claw=GeneralizedHookeanSolidConstitutiveLaw(E=1,nu=0.3) # Generalized Hookean solid constitutive law
		self.P=self.define_global_parameter(P=0) # Pressure on the circumference of the disc
		self.polar_implementation=False # Use radial polar coordinates only
		
	    def define_problem(self):        
		# Base equations, irrespective of the coordinate system
		eqs=MeshFileOutput()        
		eqs+=DeformableSolidEquations(constitutive_law=self.claw,coordinate_space="C2",isotropic_growth_factor=self.Gamma)
		eqs+=SolidNormalTraction(self.P)@"circumference"                                        
		
		# Mesh, coordinate system and boundary conditions depending on whether we solve a 2d Cartesian or polar 1d problem
		if self.polar_implementation:
		    self+=LineMesh(size=1,N=20,left_name="center",right_name="circumference") # Create a line mesh for the radial direction
		    self.set_coordinate_system("axisymmetric") # Polar coordinate system
		    eqs+=DirichletBC(mesh_x=0)@"center" # Fixed in the center of the disc
		else:
		    # Case of Cartesian coordinates, we create a quarter circular mesh
		    self+=CircularMesh(radius=1,segments=["NE"])
		    eqs+=DirichletBC(mesh_x=0)@"center_to_north" # and fix the positions at the symmetry axes
		    eqs+=DirichletBC(mesh_y=0)@"center_to_east"        
		                                                


The basis setup is analogous to the previous example, i.e. we require a constitutive law which is then used in the :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.solid.DeformableSolidEquations`. Here, however, we impose the ``isotropic_growth_factor``, which lets the disc wants to grow everywhere from its undeformed configuration by :math:`\Gamma` in terms of the area. Again, a :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.solid.SolidNormalTraction` is imposed at the boundary ``circumference``. If ``polar_implementation==True``, we switch to an `axisymmetric`` coordinate system (which is a radial polar coordinate system for 1d meshes) and use a simple 1d mesh. In that case, the right boundary will be called ``circumference``, whereas the left boundary of the interval is called ``center``. At the latter, we make sure that the mesh position is fixed to the origin. If we do not solve the polar case, we do solve it on a quarter circle mesh on a 2d Cartesian coordinate system. We have to fix the mesh coordinates on the axes of symmetry in that case.

We also want to measure that current radius :math:`r` of the disc. Irrespectively of the coordinate system, we can do so by integrating over the boundary ``circumference``. We calculate two integrals, namely the line length :math:`L=\int 1\:\mathrm{d}l` and the integral over the radius :math:`R=\int \|\vec{x}\|\:\mathrm{d}l`. In case of the 2d Cartesian implementation, both integrals will be only a quarter of the full disc, but this does not matter, since the (averaged) radius of the disc can be obtained by the ratio :math:`r=R/L`:

.. code:: python
    
		# To monitor the radius of the disc, we can use IntegralObservables. We integrate over the circumference of the disc to the the line length
		# and we also integrate over r*dl
		eqs+=IntegralObservables(_linelength=1,_radius_integral=square_root(dot(var("coordinate"),var("coordinate"))))@"circumference" 
		# The radius is then given by the ratio of the integral of r and the line length
		eqs+=IntegralObservables(radius=lambda _radius_integral,_linelength:_radius_integral/_linelength)@"circumference"   
		
		self+=eqs@"domain"


In the driver code, we just iterate over the imposed pressure (starting with a negative pressure to pull the disc outwards first). To compare the actual radius :math:`r` with an analytical linearized expression (see the `oomph-lib example <https://oomph-lib.github.io/oomph-lib/doc/solid/disk_compression/html/index.html>`__ for details), we can evaluate the introduced observable and write both the numerical value and the analytical approximation to a text file in the output directory:

.. code:: python

	with CompressedDiscProblem() as problem:
	    delta_p=0.0125
	    nstep=21
	     
	    problem.P.value=-delta_p*(nstep-1)*0.5 # Start with a negative pressure (pulling the disc outwards)
	    problem.initialise()
	    problem.refine_uniformly()        
		
	    # Write a comparison output file with the radius computed from the linearized analytical solution and the numerical solution
	    outf=problem.create_text_file_output("disc_output.txt",header=["P","r_numeric","r_linear"])    
		      
	    for i in range(nstep):         
		problem.solve()
		problem.output_at_increased_time()
		rlinear=square_root(problem.Gamma)*(1-problem.P*(1+problem.claw.nu)*(1-2*problem.claw.nu))
		rnumeric=problem.get_mesh("domain/circumference").evaluate_observable("radius")
		outf.add_row(problem.P,rnumeric,rlinear)
		problem.P.value+=delta_p
