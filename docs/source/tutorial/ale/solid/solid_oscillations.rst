Oscillations of a released torsion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, only stationary solutions of deformed solid bodies were considered. Now, we go for transient dynamics of a long three-dimensional beam. We start by a deformed configuration, specifically, by applying a torsion of the beam. On one side, the beam is fixed to a solid wall.

With the previous examples in mind, it is trivial to setup the problem case. However, here we consider physical units, i.e. we have to set typical scalings to let pyoomph nondimensionalize the equations and redimensionalize the output automatically. In particular, we need a spatial scale, a temporal scale and a scale for the mass density. With these, the equations can be nondimensionalized. A typical time scale for the solid dynamics can be obtained by Young's modulus, the density and the length:

	    def __init__(self):

		theta=self.torsion*X[0]
		eqs+=InitialCondition(mesh_y=X[1]*cos(theta)+X[2]*sin(theta),mesh_z=-X[1]*sin(theta)+X[2]*cos(theta))
		eqs+=DirichletBC(mesh_x=0,mesh_y=True,mesh_z=True)@"left" # Fix the left side of the beam to the solid wall
		self+=eqs@"domain"
		
	    
	with OscillatingSolidProblem() as problem:        
	    T=problem.get_characteristic_time_scale()
	    problem.run(10*T,outstep=0.1*T,temporal_error=1)


For the torsion, we use the original undeformed beam by accessing the Lagrangian coordinates and apply the deformation by setting an initial condition for the Eulerian mesh coordinates. Note that the code generation and compilation takes a while, since the three-dimensional dynamics involves a lot of higher order tensors, inverse matrices (the contravariant metric tensor) and nonlinearities. In particular, the entries of the analytical Jacobian with respect to the moving mesh coordinates hence constitute long expressions, which bloat up the generated C code to over 3 megabytes.
