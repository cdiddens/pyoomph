Stationary solutions of a dimensional droplet with Marangoni flow and gravity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lastly, we want to check how a droplet with an equilibrium contact angle behaves under the influence of gravity and Marangoni flow. Opposed to the previous cases, this time we consider physical dimensions and calculate stationary solutions, which will reveal some pitfalls to carefully consider. We will make use of the predefined equations, which essentially do the same as e.g. the ``KinematicBC``, ``DynamicBC`` and ``SlipLength`` considered here, but allow for physical dimensions. We could implement it by hand into our versions of these equations, but this has been laid out in other examples in detail (cf. e.g. sections :numref:`secodephysdims`, :numref:`secspatialstokesdim`, :numref:`secspatialstokes_law` and :numref:`secpdemarainstab`). For simplicity, we also revert to the axisymmetric variant.

The first problem when looking for stationary solutions is the fact that the problem is non-linear, mainly due to the mesh motion. Hence, one must have a good initial guess in order for the problem to converge with a stationary solve. Since we do not know the shape *a priori*, we start with a droplet a zero gravity, zero Marangoni flow and a contact angle of :math:`90\:\mathrm{^\circ}`. For these parameters, we know that we just will have a hemisphere with vanishing velocity. We will then crank up first the gravity, then the contact angle to :math:`120\:\mathrm{^\circ}` and finally activate the Marangoni flow. To that end, we introduce three parameters to the system:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import * # main pyoomph
   from pyoomph.expressions.units import * # units like meter, etc.

   from pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes import * # Navier-Stokes equations, including free surface, contact angles
   from pyoomph.equations.ALE import * # Moving mesh

   from pyoomph.meshes.simplemeshes import CircularMesh # Mesh


   class StationaryDropletProblem(Problem):
   	def __init__(self):
   		super(StationaryDropletProblem, self).__init__()
   		self.volume=0.25*milli*liter
   		self.rho=1000*kilogram/meter**3
   		self.mu=1*milli*pascal*second
   		self.sigma0=72*milli*newton/meter
   		self.slip_length=1*micro*meter

   		# Parameter to modify the gravity (in terms of g), initially 0
   		self.param_gravity_factor = self.define_global_parameter(gravity_factor=0)
   		# Parameter to dynamically change the contact angle at run time
   		# Initially 90 deg coinciding with the initial mesh
   		self.param_contact_angle=self.define_global_parameter(contact_angle=pi/2)		
   		# Parameter to control the surface tension, sigma=sigma0*(1+sigma_gradient*(var("coordinate_x")/R0)**2), initially 0
   		self.param_sigma_gradient = self.define_global_parameter(sigma_gradient=0)
   		self.gravity=9.81*meter/second**2 # overall gravity when param_gravity_factor.value=1

We use dimensional values for the volume and the fluid parameters. The gravity will be blended in by the parameter ``param_gravity_factor``. When this parameter reaches :math:`1`, we will get a downwards acting gravity of 9.81\ :math:`\:\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s^2}`. The contact angle will be controlled by the global parameter ``param_contact_angle``, which ``value`` is initialized to :math:`90\:\mathrm{^\circ}`. Finally, ``param_sigma_gradient`` will activate Marangoni flow by letting the surface tension be

.. math:: \sigma=\sigma_0\cdot\left(1+\sigma_1\left(\frac{x}{R_0}\right)^2\right)\,,

where :math:`\sigma_1` is the parameter ``param_sigma_gradient`` and :math:`R_0` is the radius of the initial hemispherical droplet.

The :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.define_problem` method starts as follows:

.. code:: python

   	def define_problem(self):
   		R0=square_root(3*self.volume/(4*pi)*2,3) # Radius of the initial hemi-sphere
   		mesh=CircularMesh(radius=R0,segments=["NE"],outer_interface="interface",straight_interface_name={"center_to_north":"axis","center_to_east":"substrate"})
   		self.add_mesh(mesh)

   		# Find good scales to nondimensionalize the space, the time, velocity and pressure
   		self.set_scaling(spatial=R0,temporal=1*second,velocity=scale_factor("spatial")/scale_factor("temporal"))
   		self.set_scaling(pressure=self.sigma0/R0)

   		self.set_coordinate_system("axisymmetric")

   		eqs=MeshFileOutput()

   		# Navier-Stokes with gravity
   		g=self.gravity*self.param_gravity_factor*vector(0,-1) # We can change the influence of gravity by the parameter
   		eqs+=NavierStokesEquations(mass_density=self.rho,dynamic_viscosity=self.mu,gravity=g)
   		# Mesh motion and refinement of the coarse CircularMesh
   		eqs+=PseudoElasticMesh()
   		eqs+=RefineToLevel(self.initial_adaption_steps) # Refine slightly in the beginning to find the solution quickly


   		# Dirichlet boundary conditions and slip length
   		eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_x=0,mesh_x=0)@"axis"
   		eqs += DirichletBC(velocity_y=0, mesh_y=0) @ "substrate"
   		eqs +=NavierStokesSlipLength(self.slip_length)@"substrate"

   		# Free surface and contact angle. Both surface tension and contact angle depend on parameters
   		sigma=self.sigma0*(1+self.param_sigma_gradient*(var("coordinate_x")/R0)**2)
   		eqs+=NavierStokesFreeSurface(surface_tension=sigma)@"interface"
   		eqs+=NavierStokesContactAngle(self.param_contact_angle,wall_normal=vector(0,1),wall_tangent=vector(-1,0))@"interface/substrate"

Until here, it is quite trivial if you have read the previous examples. Note how we use e.g. ``param_gravity_factor`` directly to get the symbolic parameter, i.e. not its ``value`` but its symbolic value, that will be replaced by its instantaneous value during each calculation. The refinement :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.RefineToLevel` of the initial mesh will be controlled by :py:attr:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.initial_adaption_steps`. We will later set this to a small refinement level to approximate a good guess for the initial condition of the stationary solution we are looking for on a coarse mesh. This will drastically improve the computation time. The :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes.NavierStokesFreeSurface` and ``NavierStokesContactAngle`` are the predefined equivalents to the combination of ``KinematicBC`` and ``DynamicBC`` of the free surface and the ``EquilibriumContactAngle`` of the contact line developed in this chapter.

Now, we come to the most intricate problem: When solving for stationary solutions, the volume of the droplet will not be conserved at all. The reason lies in the implementation of the ``KinematicBC``. In this, we let the mesh follow the normal fluid motion. However, it involves the time derivative of the mesh coordinates, but in stationary solves, all temporal derivatives are zero. Hence, there is no guarantee at all that the volume would be conserved or even that a solution is actually found. We therefore must enforce the volume by a single Lagrange multiplier. Therefore, we will add a new ODE domain containing just the single Lagrange multiplier :math:`\lambda`, which will enforce the volume constraint by virtue of adding the Lagrange multiplier contribution

.. math:: :label: eqalevolconstr

   \lambda\left(\int_{\text{drop}} 1\:\mathrm{d}V -V_0\right)\,.

This has to be split into two contributions, namely one integral over the domain and the constant offset of the negative initial volume :math:`-V_0`. The latter part can be done as follows:

.. code:: python

   		# The volume is not conserved during stationary solving
   		# So we must add a single global Lagrange multiplier that ensures the volume

   		# Create the Lagrange multiplier "volume_lagrange", add an offset of -self.volume to the residual
   		vol_constr_eqs=GlobalLagrangeMultiplier(volume_lagrange=-self.volume)
   		vol_constr_eqs+=Scaling(volume_lagrange=scale_factor("pressure")) # Introduce the scale to nondimensionalize
   		vol_constr_eqs += TestScaling(volume_lagrange=1/self.volume) # And also a test scale, which is just the inverse
   		self.add_equations(vol_constr_eqs@"volume_constraint") # add it to an "ODE" domain called "volume_constraint"

The :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.GlobalLagrangeMultiplier` will just define a Lagrange multiplier with the name ``volume_lagrange`` and considering the offset :math:`-V_0` to the weak form. Since we have a dimensional problem, we also have to set the scaling of ``volume_lagrange`` and for the corresponding test function. This can be changed by adding ``Scaling`` and ``TestScaling`` objects to the ODE equation. One might wonder why we choose a scale of the pressure for the Lagrange multiplier, but this will become clear in a minute. Finally, the Lagrange multiplier is added to the ODE domain ``"volume_constraint"``.

There is still the integral portion missing. Since it involves an integral over the droplet ``"domain"``, we have to add it to the equations on ``"domain"``. To that end, we use :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.WeakContribution`:

.. code:: python

   		# bind the volume enforcing Lagrange multiplier
   		vol_constr_lagr=var("volume_lagrange",domain="volume_constraint")
   		# And add the dimensional integral 1*dx over the droplet to the residual of the Lagrange multiplier
   		# In total, we then solve [integral_droplet 1*dx - self. volume] on the test space of the Lagrange multiplier
   		# This is indeed the volume constraint
   		eqs+=WeakContribution(1,testfunction(vol_constr_lagr),dimensional_dx=True)

The :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.WeakContribution` will just add the integral :math:`\int 1\:\mathrm{d}V` to the test space of the global Lagrange multiplier :math:`\lambda`, i.e. accounting for the first term in :math:numref:`eqalevolconstr`. Note the ``dimensional_dx=True`` argument, which carries out the integral with physical dimensions, i.e. not in non-dimensional coordinates. This is required to get a dimensional volume contribution in :math:`\:\mathrm{m^3}`.

So far, so good. The volume constraint is assembled correctly. But there is no feedback yet on the droplet. We must impose the value of the Lagrange multiplier somewhere back to the system, otherwise it is just redundant. The idea is to add an additional pressure contribution to the droplet, which is proportional to the Lagrange multiplier. This can be understood easily if the initially hemispherical droplet without any gravity or flow is considered. As argued before, in absence of the additional Lagrange multiplier, the volume is not conserved and hence, there is an infinite number of solutions possible, namely for each volume :math:`V` we get a unique Laplace pressure due to the different curvature. When we add the contribution of the Lagrange multiplier to the pressure, the system is only in agreement if the volume :math:`V` is indeed the volume :math:`V_0` and the corresponding Laplace pressure in the droplet is Laplace pressure corresponding to this volume. If the volume :math:`V` deviates from :math:`V_0`, the additional contribution to the pressure from the non-zero Lagrange multiplier will alter the pressure throughout the droplet and forces the droplet to attain the volume :math:`V_0` with the corresponding Laplace pressure during the solution procedure.

We hence add the Lagrange pressure as additional normal traction, i.e. analogous to the Laplace pressure stemming from the surface tension and curvature.

.. code:: python

   		# Finally, the Lagrange multiplier must also yield feedback to the problem
   		# It can be done easily by adding additional pressure whenever the droplet's volume does not match
   		# We hence add a normal traction (pressure) proportional to the volume Lagrange multiplier
   		eqs+=NeumannBC(velocity=vol_constr_lagr*var("normal"))@"interface"

   		eqs+=SpatialErrorEstimator(velocity=1)

   		self.add_equations(eqs@"domain")

The problem definition ends with a :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.SpatialErrorEstimator` for the velocity, which will be relevant when Marangoni flow is activated at the end.

	Starting with a coarse hemispherical mesh, we first crank up the gravity, then modify the contact angle and finally solve for the Marangoni flow with refinement.


Now, we can use the solution procedure, i.e. starting with a coarse hemispherical droplet, cranking up gravity, subsequently adjusting the contact angle and finally blending in the Marangoni flow. Only at the final step, we do mesh refinement, since the other steps where just made to approach a good initial guess for the final solution:

.. code:: python

   if __name__=="__main__":
   	with StationaryDropletProblem() as problem:

   		problem.initial_adaption_steps=2 # adapt the initial mesh only a bit for fast calculation
   		problem.max_refinement_level=7 # final adaption, very fine

   		# Start without gravity, no Marangoni flow and at 90 deg contact angle
   		problem.param_gravity_factor.value=0
   		problem.param_sigma_gradient.value = 0
   		problem.param_contact_angle.value = pi/2

   		problem.solve() # This stationary solve is trivial
   		problem.output() # Output first step

   		# Ramp up gravity by arclength continuation
   		problem.go_to_param(gravity_factor=1,startstep=0.2,final_adaptive_solve=False)
   		problem.output_at_increased_time()

   		# Ramp up the contact angle by arclength continuation
   		problem.go_to_param(contact_angle=110*degree, startstep=5*degree,final_adaptive_solve=False)
   		problem.output_at_increased_time()

   		# Ramp up Marangoni flow by arclength continuation
   		problem.go_to_param(sigma_gradient=0.001, startstep=0.001,final_adaptive_solve=True)
   		problem.output_at_increased_time()

The method :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.go_to_param` will gradually increase/decrease the specified parameter (identified by the name passed to :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.get_global_parameter` in the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` constructor) to the desired value via arc length continuation. With the ``startstep`` argument, we can optionally set the first try of the parameter increment. If not set, it will try to directly reach the desired parameter value, which is not always successful and results in a lot of unsuccessful tries followed by a retry with a reduced step. The ``final_adaptive_solve`` is set to ``False`` in the first two parameter increases. This means we do not adapt after the parameter value has been reached. At the very end, we set it to ``True`` to ultimately adapt the final result to maximum accuracy, selected by :py:attr:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.max_refinement_level`. The results are depicted in :numref:`figaledropletmaragrav`. The problem would never converge if one directly tries to solve for the last step starting with the hemispherical initial mesh.

.. note::

   We have enforced the volume in :math:numref:`eqalevolconstr` by integrating :math:`1` over the droplet domain. While this is definitely acceptable, the volume contribution of each element depends on all nodal positions of the element. This leads to a lot of computational costs for the assembly of the Jacobian and also for the solution of the latter.

   Alternatively, we can use a trick so that only the nodal positions on the boundaries contribute. To that end, first note that :math:`\nabla\cdot \vec{x}=d`, where :math:`d` is the number of dimensions (in axisymmetric coordinates, it will be :math:`3` as well). We can hence write the contribution :math:`(1,\eta)_\text{drop}` (with :math:`\eta` being the testfunction of :math:`\lambda`) as :math:`1/d\:(\nabla\cdot\vec{x},_\eta)_\text{drop}`. Now, we can apply the divergence theorem to obtain :math:`1/d\:(\nabla\cdot\vec{x},_\eta)_\text{drop}=1/d\:\langle  \vec{x}\cdot\vec{n},\eta \rangle`, where the interface integral has to be applied to all interfaces. However, at the substrate and at the axis of symmetry, :math:`\vec{x}\cdot\vec{n}` is zero, so that only the free surface contributes.

   Instead of ``WeakContribution(1,testfunction(vol_constr_lagr),dimensional_dx=True)``, we could hence define ``x_dot_n=dot(var("coordinate"),var("normal"))`` and add ``WeakContribution(1/3*x_dot_n,testfunction(vol_constr_lagr),dimensional_dx=True)@"interface"``.

   This will speed up the assembly and the solving.
