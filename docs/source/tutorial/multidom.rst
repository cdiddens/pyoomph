Multi-Domain Methods
====================

So far, we only considered a single bulk domain, sometimes with additional equations at the boundaries or with an external Lagrange multiplier. However, a lot of physical problems must be modeled by multiple domains that are coupled at the mutual interfaces. This section is devoted to these kind of problems.
