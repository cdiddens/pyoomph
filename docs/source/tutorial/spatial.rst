Spatial Differential Equations
==============================

While the previous chapter was dedicated on temporal ODEs, this section will focus on pure spatial differential equations, i.e. without temporal derivatives, but with spatial derivatives instead. This necessitates a discretization in space of a given particular geometry in either one, two or three spatial dimensions.
