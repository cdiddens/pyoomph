Example: Rayleigh-Taylor instability
------------------------------------

Similar to the problem discussed in :numref:`secpdertinstab`, we now want to setup the same problem with the :py:func:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.CompositionFlowEquations`:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.equations.multi_component import *
   from pyoomph.materials import *
   import pyoomph.materials.default_materials # Alternatively, define the materials by hand

   class RayleighTaylorProblem(Problem):
       def __init__(self):
           super(RayleighTaylorProblem, self).__init__()
           self.box_height,self.box_width=1*milli*meter,0.25*milli*meter # box size
           self.Nx=5 # Num elements in x direction
           self.mixture=Mixture(get_pure_liquid("water")+0.5*get_pure_liquid("glycerol")) # Default mixture
           self.temperature=20*celsius # Temperature : Required for some properties
           self.gravity=9.81*vector(0,-1)*meter/second**2

We import the material library and also the default materials. Alternatively, we could write our own material library file or define custom fluids and mixtures thereof in the very same python script of the code. Then, we initialize the property :py:func:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.Mixture` by a default mixture, but in the run script, the user can change it easily.

For the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.define_problem` method, we first have to set the ``spatial`` and the ``temporal`` scale. All other required scales can be set to reasonable values by using the :py:func:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.BaseLiquidProperties.set_reference_scaling_to_problem` of the liquid:

.. code:: python


       def define_problem(self):
           # Mesh
           self.add_mesh(RectangularQuadMesh(size=[self.box_width,self.box_height],N=[self.Nx,int(self.Nx*self.box_height/self.box_width)]))
           # Spatial and temporal scales must be set by hand
           self.set_scaling(spatial=self.box_width,temporal=1*second)
           # Set remaining scales by the liquid properties
           self.mixture.set_reference_scaling_to_problem(self,temperature=self.temperature)
           # define global constants "temperature" and "absolute_pressure". It might be required by the fluid properties
           self.define_named_var(temperature=self.temperature,absolute_pressure=1*atm)

It is important to pass the ``temperature`` variable here since :py:func:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.BaseLiquidProperties.set_reference_scaling_to_problem` internally evaluates e.g. the :py:attr:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.BaseLiquidProperties.dynamic_viscosity` and :py:attr:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.MaterialProperties.mass_density` to find a good scaling. Since these properties might depend on the temperature, we must supply some ``temperature`` for that. Furthermore, the initial composition is substituted in these expressions so that eventually only constant values appear for the reference density and viscosity used for the non-dimensionalization.

Furthermore, since the problem is isothermal and also pressure fluctuations are not allowed to have an effect on the fluid properties, we must tell pyoomph what to use for the fields ``"temperature"`` and ``"absolute_pressure"``, when any fluid property depend on these. Therefore, we set these variables globally to constants by the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.define_named_var`. Whenever pyoomph finds any occurrence of e.g. ``var("temperature")`` and there is no such field defined in the current domain, these values will be used instead. Thereby, all temperature-dependence will just be evaluated at this constant value. Since this substitution and successive simplification of the properties happens before the C code generation, a potential temperature-dependence of the fluid properties does not slow down the simulation.

The code is now just a :py:func:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.CompositionFlowEquations` of the :py:func:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.Mixture` with the desired ``gravity``:

.. code:: python

           eqs=MeshFileOutput()
           eqs+=CompositionFlowEquations(self.mixture,spatial_errors=True,gravity=self.gravity)
           for side in ["left","right","bottom"]:
               eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_x=0,velocity_y=True)@side
               # Top side must be open: The density is not constant and hence we require in/outflow somewhere!

           self.add_equations(eqs@"domain")

For the boundary conditions, however, we have to be careful: Since the mass density is in general not constant the total volume will not be conserved. Hence, one side of the domain must allow for in-/outflow. Alternatively, we could also apply a no-slip condition at the ``"top"`` interface, but pass the argument ``boussinesq=True`` to the :py:func:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.CompositionFlowEquations`. In that case, the Boussinesq approximation is applied, i.e. the continuity equation simplifies to :math:`\nabla\cdot \vec{u}=0`. Then, the volume remains conserved, but we have to fix again one degree of the pressure (cf. :numref:`secspatialstokespuredirichlet`).

Finally, the user can change the :py:func:`~pyoomph.materials.generic.Mixture` and prescribe any suitable :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.InitialCondition` for the liquid:

.. code:: python

   with RayleighTaylorProblem() as problem:
       # Let the user select any mixture
       problem.mixture = Mixture(get_pure_liquid("water") + 0.5 * get_pure_liquid("glycerol"))

       # And also formulate the initial condition
       x,y=var(["coordinate_x","coordinate_y"])
       xrel, yrel = var("coordinate_x") / problem.box_width, var("coordinate_y") / problem.box_height - 0.5
       wg_init = 0.5*(1+tanh(100 * (yrel - 0.0125 * cos(2 * pi * xrel))))
       problem.additional_equations+=InitialCondition(massfrac_glycerol=wg_init)@"domain"

       problem.max_refinement_level=4
       problem.run(10*second,startstep=0.1*second,maxstep=0.5*second,outstep=True,spatial_adapt=1,temporal_error=1)

The results are shown in :numref:`figmcflowrtmcflow`. Due to the high viscosity and low diffusivity in the limit of pure glycerol, the flow and diffusion dynamics mostly happen in the lower half.

The benefit of using the material library is that it is now trivial to exchange it to e.g. an ethanol-water mixture or even ternary mixtures with just a single line of code now (provided the desired fluids and mixtures thereof are already in the material library).
