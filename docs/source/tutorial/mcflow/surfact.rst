Surfactants
-----------

Opposed to normal mixture components, surfactants are allowed to have an excess concentration at the very interface. In pyoomph, surfactants at the interface are represented by fields :math:`\Gamma_\alpha` (measured in :math:`\:\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{m^2}`), where :math:`\alpha` enumerates all present surfactants.
