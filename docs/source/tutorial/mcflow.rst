Multi-Component Flow
====================

pyoomph has a set of predefined equations, that allows to easily add flow of multi-component mixtures, potentially with mass transfer between different phases, surfactants and thermal effects. All these equations are just :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations` or :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.InterfaceEquations` and all required knowledge to develop these by hand yourself was already introduced throughout this manual. Therefore, we will not go into the details of the implementation of these predefined equations, but feel free to have a look at the code :py:mod:`pyoomph.equations.multi_component`.
