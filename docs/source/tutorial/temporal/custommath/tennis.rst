Playing tennis in pyoomph - custom expression with dimensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next problem will be a bit more comprehensive and it will involve several techniques we have learned so far, namely using physical dimensions, custom math expressions and temporal adaptivity. We want to simulate a simple tennis match. As in all physics exams, there is no air friction acting on the ball, the problem is one-dimensional and the tennis rackets behave as a Hookian spring, but only if the position of the ball exceeds the position of the racket. Mathematically, we solve

.. math:: m\ddot{x}=F_1(x)+F_2(x)

where :math:`F_1` and :math:`F_2` are the forces of the rackets, which take action whenever the ball reaches the positions :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_2` of the rackets:

.. math:: F_1(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix} -k_1(x-X_1) & \text{if} \quad  x>X_1 \\ 0 &  \text{otherwise} \end{matrix} \right. \quad \text{and} \quad  F_2(x)=\left\{\begin{matrix} -k_2(x-X_2) & \text{if} \quad  x<X_2 \\ 0 &  \text{otherwise} \end{matrix} \right.

For these forces, we write our :py:class:`~pyoomph.expressions.cb.CustomMathExpression` in python, however, now taking the positions in meters and resulting in a dimensional force with the unit :math:`\:\mathrm{N}`:

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.expressions import *
   from pyoomph.expressions.units import *

   # Force of a tennis racket as function of the ball position and the racket position
   # This will create a function Force(ball_position,racket_position)
   # Both positions must have the unit of meter
   # And the result is a force measured in Newton
   class TennisRacket(CustomMathExpression):
       def __init__(self,*,direction=1,spring_constant=1000*newton/meter):
           super(TennisRacket, self).__init__()
           self.direction=direction # sign of the force
           # Store a non-dimensional value of the spring constant
           self.k_in_N_per_m=float(spring_constant/(newton/meter))

       # Input arguments are converted to numerical values by treating the input as meter (for both arguments, ball and racket position)
       def get_argument_unit(self,index:int):
           return meter # return meter, no matter whether index==0 or index==1

       # The result is obtained by multiplying the result of 'eval' by newton
       def get_result_unit(self):
           return newton

       # This routine is now entirely nondimensional
       def eval(self,arg_array):
           # get the input values (numerical float values!)
           ball_pos_in_m=arg_array[0] # measured int meter
           racket_pos_in_m=arg_array[1] # measured int meter
           # calculate the distance (also in meter)
           distance_in_m=self.direction*(ball_pos_in_m-racket_pos_in_m)
           if distance_in_m>=0: # in front of the racket
               return 0.0 # numerical float value of the force [in newton]
           else:
               # Force of the racket on the ball
               force_in_newton=-self.direction*self.k_in_N_per_m*distance_in_m
               return force_in_newton # result is treated in newton

To allow for arguments with physical units as input arguments, we must implement the function :py:meth:`~pyoomph.expressions.cb.CustomMathExpression.get_argument_unit`, which returns the unit used for non-dimensionalization of the input arguments. The argument ``index`` here can be used to identify which argument to the custom math function is meant. Furthermore, the result of our calculation, i.e. of the force :math:`F_1` and :math:`F_2` shall be measured in :math:`\:\mathrm{N}`, which we tell pyoomph by implementing the method :py:meth:`~pyoomph.expressions.cb.CustomMathExpression.get_result_unit`. Everything else, i.e. the entire calculation of the force will now be done by ``float`` numbers in Python. The values stored in ``arg_array`` are ``float`` numbers giving the position of the ball and the position of the racket in meters. The ``return`` value of eval must also be a ``float``, which is eventually multiplied by the result of :py:meth:`~pyoomph.expressions.cb.CustomMathExpression.get_result_unit`, i.e. by :math:`\:\mathrm{N}`, to give a dimensional force.

The class for the equation for the ball position :math:`x` is again trivial:

.. code:: python

   class NewtonsLaw1d(ODEEquations):
       def __init__(self,mass,force):
           super(NewtonsLaw1d, self).__init__()
           self.mass=mass
           self.force=force

       def define_fields(self):
           # bind the scale factors (defined on problem level)
           T=scale_factor("temporal")
           X=scale_factor("spatial")        
           # we set the scales as well as the test function scales here locally in the equation class
           self.define_ode_variable("x",scale=X,testscale=T**2/X) # same test scale as in the dimensional harmonic oscillator before
           self.define_ode_variable("xdot",scale=X/T,testscale=T/X) # velocity scales as X/T, test scale T/X will cancel this out

       def define_residuals(self):
           x,xdot=var(["x","xdot"])
           residual=(partial_t(xdot)-self.force/self.mass)*testfunction(x)
           residual+=(partial_t(x)-xdot)*testfunction(xdot)
           self.add_residual(residual)

Different as before, we define not only the test function scales in the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.BaseEquations.define_fields` method, but also the scales itself by adding the argument ``scale`` to the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.ODEEquations.define_ode_variable`. The position :math:`x` will be nondimensionalized by a scale ``"spatial"``, which will be set later. The velocity :math:`\dot x`, i.e. ``xdot``, is nondimensionalized by ``"spatial"``/``"temporal"``, which is a reasonable choice for a velocity. The test scales are again chosen that way that all physical units cancel out in the added residual. Both missing scales ``"spatial"`` and ``"temporal"`` are set at problem level using :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.set_scaling`.

.. code:: python

   class TennisProblem(Problem):
       def __init__(self):
           super(TennisProblem, self).__init__()
           self.top_racket_force=TennisRacket(direction=-1,spring_constant=5*newton/meter)
           self.bottom_racket_force=TennisRacket(direction=1,spring_constant=20*newton/meter)
           self.top_position=10*meter
           self.bottom_position=-10*meter
           self.ball_mass=60*gram
           self.ball_pos0=0*meter
           self.ball_velo0=10*meter/second

       def define_problem(self):
           self.set_scaling(spatial=1*meter,temporal=1*second)
           ball_pos=var("x")
           racket_force=self.top_racket_force(ball_pos,self.top_position)
           racket_force+=self.bottom_racket_force(ball_pos,self.bottom_position)
           racket_force=subexpression(racket_force)

           ball_eq=NewtonsLaw1d(mass=self.ball_mass,force=racket_force)
           ball_eq+=InitialCondition(x=self.ball_pos0,xdot=self.ball_velo0)
           ball_eq += ODEObservables(top_position_in_m=self.top_position/meter,bottom_position_in_m=self.bottom_position/meter)
           ball_eq+=ODEFileOutput()
           ball_eq+=TemporalErrorEstimator(x=1,xdot=1)

           self.add_equations(ball_eq@"ball")

   if __name__=="__main__":
       with TennisProblem() as problem:
           problem.run(endtime=20*second,outstep=True,temporal_error=0.0025,startstep=0.01*second)

In the constructor, we initialize two rackets, one at the top and one at the bottom with different values for the spring constant :math:`k`. Thereby, we provide the two functions that calculate the force of the racket as function of the ball position and the racket position. In the :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.define_problem` method, first the scalings ``"spatial"`` and ``"temporal"`` are set at problem level. The former is then used for the scale of ``"x"`` and the quotient of both is used for ``"xdot"`` at equation level. Then, the equation of motion, ``NewtonsLaw1d`` is constructed, with a force consisting the sum of both racket forces. Again, it is encapsulated in a :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.generic.subexpression` as recommended for additional computation speed. The remainder is trivial, but note that again a :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.generic.TemporalErrorEstimator` is added to monitor the error made by the adaptive time stepping.

	Tennis with pyoomph. One clearly sees how the dynamic time stepping kicks in when the forces of the rackets are acting.


Finally, we run the problem, again with an adjustable accepted ``temporal_error`` value for dynamic time stepping. The effect of the dynamic time stepping is visible in :numref:`figodetennis`, where clearly the steps are smaller whenever the ball is subject to the force of a racket.

As a last note, we also can let the players move easily, since the positions of the rackets, stored in the problem class in the members ``top_position`` and ``bottom_position``, is passed to the custom expressions ``TennisRacket`` as second argument. Hence, a slight modification before running allows for motion of the players, see :numref:`figodetennismoving` This feature, i.e. changing the problem by modifying the expressions, is later on helpful, when e.g. modifying the mass density or dynamic viscosity of a liquid mixture.

.. code:: python

   if __name__=="__main__":
       with TennisProblem() as problem:
           t=var("time")
           # Let the players move up and down
           problem.bottom_position=-10*meter+4*meter*sin(2*pi * 0.25*hertz*t)
           problem.top_position = 10 * meter + 6 * meter * cos(2*pi * 0.1*hertz*t)
           problem.run(endtime=20*second,outstep=True,temporal_error=0.0025,startstep=0.01*second)

	:class: with-shadow
	:width: 70%
	
	The tennis players are moving. Note that the motion of the players is not well resolved, since the dynamic time stepping is not affected by their positions at all when the ball is in mid air. Also, the velocity of the ball is reduced when a player is moving backward during striking and enhanced when moving forward.


.. warning::

   The usage of :py:class:`~pyoomph.expressions.cb.CustomMathExpression` should be considered as last resort, since the call of a python function is quite expensive compared to the execution on the generated ``C`` code. In particular, here one could have used ``heaviside((var("x")-self.top_position)/meter)`` to kick in the force of the racket instead. The division by ``meter`` is required in the argument of :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.heaviside`, since functions like :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.sin`, :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.cos`, but also :py:func:`~pyoomph.expressions.heaviside` require an argument without any dimension.
