# Description

pyoomph is a object-oriented multi-physics finite element framework.
It is mainly a custom high level python frontend for the main functionalities (but by far not all) of the powerful C++ library [`oomph-lib`](http://www.oomph-lib.org).

For performance reasons, pyoomph uses [`GiNaC`](https://www.ginac.de/) and [`CLN`](https://www.ginac.de/CLN) to automatically generate C code for the equations you have entered in python. It automatically generates C code for symbolically derived Jacobian matrices, parameter derivatives and Hessians. These even include the complicated derivatives with respect to the moving mesh coordinates on a symbolical level. The generated code is compiled and linked back to the running python script, either with the [`TinyC`](https://bellard.org/tcc/) compiler (invoked by [`tccbox`](https://github.com/metab0t/tccbox)) or, when installed, with a more performant alternative like [`gcc`](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [`LLVM/clang`](https://clang.llvm.org/) or [`MSBuild`](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild).

If you want to use the full flexibility of oomph-lib, you are probably better suited using [`oomph-lib`](http://www.oomph-lib.org) directly. If your want to use python to solve equations on a single static mesh, you might want to check out [`FEniCS`](https://fenicsproject.org/) instead. Also, have a look at [`NGSolve`](https://ngsolve.org/) or [`nutils`](https://nutils.org/) which have similar and complementary features.
If you are looking for a python framework for multi-physics problems formulated on (potentially multiple) moving meshes, including the possibility of (azimuthal) bifurcation tracking, pyoomph might be the right choice for you.

**pyoomph is still in an early stage of development:** While most features work nicely, it is neither feature-complete, nor free of bugs.

pyoomph itself is distributed as combined work under the GPL v3 license. However, mind the third-party licences stated below, in particular when distributing derived work or redistributing pyoomph. The full license file can be found in [COPYING](COPYING).

## Third-Party-Licenses 

The distribution of pyoomph **contains code** taken from **other authors/projects**:

- In [`src/thirdparty/oomph-lib/include`](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/src/thirdparty/oomph-lib/include), you find the necessary main files of [`oomph-lib`](http://www.oomph-lib.org), ([LGPL v2.1 or later license](https://github.com/oomph-lib/oomph-lib/blob/main/LICENCE)). Minor **modifications**, as mentioned in [src/thirdparty/INFO_oomph-lib](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/src/thirdparty/INFO_oomph-lib), had to be made. Furthermore, code parts of these oomph-lib files had been copied to corresponding derived classes of pyoomph.
- A copy of the header-only library [`nanoflann`](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) is located in [`src/thirdparty/nanoflann.hpp`](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/src/thirdparty/nanoflann.hpp), ([BSD license](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/blob/master/COPYING)).

- The file [src/pyginacstruct.hpp](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/src/pyginacstruct.hpp) is strongly based on the file [structure.h](https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob_plain;f=ginac/structure.h;hb=HEAD) of [GiNaC](https://www.ginac.de/) ([GPL v2 or later license](https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD)).
- A copy of the library [Project Nayuki/smallest enslosing circle](https://www.nayuki.io/page/smallest-enclosing-circle) ([LGPL v3 license or later](https://github.com/nayuki/Nayuki-web-published-code/blob/master/smallest-enclosing-circle/COPYING.LESSER.txt)) is added (after adding type specifications) to [pyoomph/utils/smallest_circle.py](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/pyoomph/utils/smallest_circle.py).

### <a id="cite"></a>Citing of material properties and activity models
- pyoomph includes some parameters of the [AIOMFAC](http://www.aiomfac.caltech.edu/) activity model in [pyoomph/materials/UNIFAC/aiomfac.py](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/pyoomph/materials/UNIFAC/aiomfac.py). These are based on the source code of [AIOMFAC](https://github.com/andizuend/AIOMFAC) ([GPL v3 license](https://github.com/andizuend/AIOMFAC/blob/master/LICENSE)). Cite the [relevant scientific publications](https://aiomfac.lab.mcgill.ca/citation.html) when publishing results based on the AIOMFAC activity model.
- Alternatively, you can choose the [original UNIFAC model](https://www.ddbst.com/published-parameters-unifac.html) or the [modified UNIFAC model (Dortmund)](https://www.ddbst.com/PublishedParametersUNIFACDO.html). In that case, cite the publications listed under these links if you use these models. 
- For more accurate results, it is advised to obtain the updated parameters for the [UNIFAC Consortium](https://unifac.ddbst.com/unifac_.html). Such updated parameter sets can be implemented by hand following the templates for the free parameters in [pyoomph/materials/UNIFAC/](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/tree/main/pyoomph/materials/UNIFAC). The usage of such updated parameters of the UNIFAC Consortium are **restricted to the terms of use** of the UNIFAC Consortium.
- When using the material properties from [pyoomph/materials/default_materials.py](https://github.com/cdiddens/pyoomph/blob/main/pyoomph/materials/default_materials.py), please have a look at the comments in this file to cite the correct papers.
