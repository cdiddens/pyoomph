# Changelog

## [0.1.9] 

Roughly five months and 250+ commits since the 0.1.8 release. The two biggest
themes are a new mesh-element family (pyramids, wedges, and their bubble-enriched
tetrahedral relatives, all with proper 3D facet support) and a substantially
reworked build/release pipeline (CMake + scikit-build-core and source distributions). 

Alongside that:
several new solver backends, and a long tail of correctness fixes in the FEM core.

### Added

- **New element types**: pyramids and wedges, including C1/C2 variants and the
  bubble-enriched `TetraC1TB`/`Tetra3dC1TB`/`Tetra3dC2TB` tetrahedra, with
  proper facet-based boundary/interface detection (replacing boundary-node-only
  identification) and 3D Gmsh facet support.
- **New solver backends**: a macOS Accelerate-framework linear solver and
  eigensolver. PETSc gained automatic field-split   index sets and general solver improvements.
- **`pyoomph check`** (`python -m pyoomph check solver|eigen|compiler|all`):
  reworked solver selection, checking, and reporting, including install hints
  for missing optional dependencies (MKL/Pardiso, PETSc/SLEPc).
- **Parallel/MPI groundwork**: basic METIS-based mesh partitioning, basic load
  balancing, Dirichlet-by-matrix-manipulation as an alternative to the classical
  implementation, and distributed Dirichlet index spreading over MPI.
- **New physics/numerics**:  latent heat support for `PrescribedMassTransfer`, 
  time derivatives of integrals, matrix-valued `IntegralExpression`s, 
  an `InvertSymmetricMatrix`  multi-return expression, additional local dof constraints 
  (C1 confinement /  ALE constraining), an adaptive bifurcation tracker, 
  and `RemesherViaRecreation`.
- **Source distribution (sdist)** generation, wired into CI and verified with a
  full fresh-environment install-from-source test.
- New GCL and Rayleigh-Plateau-instability tutorials; an inverse-problem
  tutorial; `AGENTS.md`/agent-facing docs for AI-assisted development.
- numerical-data-file loading as numpy array with column and parameter information

### Changed / Improved

- Extensive internal refactoring of hanging-dof handling (new space-information
  structures, restructured hang buffers, streamlined `fill_hang_info_with_equations`)
  and of DG field handling.
- The compiled core extension moved from a top-level `_pyoomph` module to
  `pyoomph._pyoomph_core`.
- Removed unused oomph-lib thirdparty code (FSI, multi-domain, spectral
  elements, DG elements, spines, triangle meshes, the LAPACK QZ eigensolver) —
  a meaningful source-tree size reduction.
- Solid mechanics performance improved; 1D axisymmetry coordinate (polar) range
  reworked to `2x2` matrices in the vector gradients instead of `3x3` with a zero row/column.
- All of `src/` (excluding thirdparty code) commented and documented, with
  pybind11 binding docstrings added throughout.
- Large tutorial-documentation pass: numerous code blocks converted from
  downloadable scripts to `literalinclude`, several documentation gaps filled,
  full spellcheck.

### Fixed

- Interface-dof bugs breaking adaptive multi-physics interfaces, C1TB
  interfaces, and edge cases on interfaces with opposite orientation.
- Hele-Shaw factors corrected
- `CSplineInterpolator` bug; Jacobian sanity checking added to catch a class of
  silent bug where a misnamed override (e.g. `define_residual` instead of the
  correct `define_residuals`) would otherwise just never get called.
- residual/Jacobian checking (e.g. "has residual but no Jacobian row/col"); 
  DG element sorting bug in Jacobian assembly (wrong comparator);
  an accidentally-commented line that left Jacobian codegen empty in some
  cases.
- Higher-codimension (codim-3) code paths; vector gradients on higher
  codimensions.
- hanging dofs for 2D facets on 3D meshes; 
  finite differences and 2D hanging interface dofs on 3D meshes; 
- a load_state issue on adaptive meshes fixed
- an unsymmetric-mass-matrix case now warns instead of
  silently producing wrong results on scipy/ARPACK-based eigensolvers.
- A segfault in `MPI_Init` when extra CLI arguments are passed.

### Windows support

- Fixed `WinError 32` ("file in use") crashes in `pyoomph check` and any
  script that tears down a `Problem` while its temp/output directory is being
  deleted: the log file and persistent output files (`ODEFileOutput`,
  `IntegralObservableOutput`) are now closed proactively in `Problem.release()`
  instead of waiting for eventual garbage collection, matching the existing
  proactive DLL-unload behavior.
- Fixed a related `ValueError` ("path is on mount 'C:', start on mount 'D:'")
  when the code/output directory and working directory are on different
  drives, by falling back to an absolute compiler source path.
- Windows wheels now build via MSYS2/MinGW + CMake instead of the old
  `setup.py`-based flow; added an on-demand CI workflow.

### Packaging & CI

- Migrated the build backend from `setup.py` to CMake + scikit-build-core.
- Wheels are now built via `cibuildwheel` across Linux (manylinux), macOS
  (x86_64 and arm64), and Windows, looping over Python 3.10-3.15 (3.15 via
  `cpython-prerelease`) in a single job per platform.
- Added a dedicated workflow to prebuild static CLN/GiNaC as reusable
  artifacts, with auto-detection of current CLN/GiNaC versions from
  ginac.de (falling back to known-good pinned versions if that lookup fails).
- Fixed a `.gitignore` bug (`*.txt` was silently excluding the tracked root
  `CMakeLists.txt`, among others, from the sdist) that had made the sdist
  fundamentally unbuildable.
